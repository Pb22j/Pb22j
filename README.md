### 🧠 About Me

- I enjoy **breaking problems down like a detective case**
- Strong interest in **algorithms, data structures, and logic-based challenges**
- Currently working on **Java projects, AI examples, and university coursework**
- I believe **clean code = clear reasoning**

Sometimes bugs hide better than criminals — but they always leave traces 🧐
